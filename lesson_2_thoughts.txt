What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need it?

When you initialize a repository git does all of its necessary things so that it
can start to track the files in the directory. without this git would be
useless.

how is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers? 

It is the middle man between the 2 things. It allows you to add everything 
necessary to make a logical commit.
