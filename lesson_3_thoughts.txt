When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

There are very few times that you would want to keep your repository local. 
keeping it remote means you keep an automatic backup.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having git
automatically stay up to date with your remote repository?

If it is automatic then some code you are working on could be changed by someone
else and mess your code up.

Describe the difference between forks, clones and branches. When would you use
one instead of the other?

forks are only used on github servers, clones do the same thing as forks except
on your machine, and branches allow you to break up your work so your not
always working on production code.
